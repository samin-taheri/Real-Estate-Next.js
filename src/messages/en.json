      "faq-subtitle": "All you need to know for investment or citizenship in Turkey. These questions and answers will be very useful to you.",
      "faq-question-1": "Can I buy a Property in Turkey?",
      "faq-answer-1": "If you are reading this, you obviously are curious to know if you can or not buy a property in any town of Turkey. Before 2012, Turkish laws regarding foreigners ownership were very strict, and mostly based on mutuality, meaning that if a Turkish citizen can buy a property in your country, you would also be able to buy a property in Turkey. However, in 2012 new laws made it easier for citizens of over 120 countries to buy a property in Turkey. Based on new laws, almost every citizen from major countries have rights to buy a property in Turkey. (If you want to check, than have a look to the uppdated list below). If you are a citizen from these countries, you can NOT buy a property in Turkey:  North Korea, Cuba, Nigeria, Armenia, Yemen, Syria. Special conditions are available for Syrians, please contact us for further details If you are a citizen from these countries, special conditions apply: China, Israel, Fiji, East Timor, India, Palestine. If you are a citizen from these countries, you can buy a property without any special permission: USA,Germany,Jordan,Denmark,UAE, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Argentina, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina, Faso, Burundi, Chad, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Republic of Cote D'Ivoire, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea, South Africa, South Korea, Georgia, Croatia, Holland, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Canada, Kenya, Northern, Cyprus, Colombia, Kosova, Kirgizistan, Libya, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Mali, Moldova, Monaco, Namibia, Niger, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Peru, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, United Kingdom, Ireland, Iran, Iraq, Spain.",
      "faq-question-2": "Can I Buy any Type of Property in Turkey?",
      "faq-answer-2": "Restrictions apply for some special type of properties (historically classified properties etc.) Please use below form for send us an email if you are looking for a specific type of property and we will happily provide all information for you.",
      "faq-question-3": " How Does Property Ownership Work in Turkey for foreigners?",
      "faq-answer-3": "If you have the right to buy a property in Turkey, ownership rights are exactly the same for both Turkish citizens and non-Turkish citizens. The first thing to know is that Turkish properties are Freehold, meaning that once you own it, you have %100 right on it (contrary to Leasehold, where, for example as in some countries like Dubai etc. you actually own the rights of the property for a certain time – 49 years, 99 years etc..)  When your purchase is fully paid, the Seller will deliver the rights of the property to you, and a new TAPU (title deed, click here Blogg TAPU ya link var) for a picture of a sample TAPU) will be issued on your name. Once the TAPU registered on your name, you now own all the rights on the property, i.e you can sell it back anytime you want, rent it as much as you want, and as long as you want, keep it for life, donate it, use it for a loan, in short, the property is yours and free to you to make whatever you want with it.",
      "faq-question-4": "What are the rules for Buying a Property in Turkey?",
      "faq-answer-4": "There are some few details which you should know before you start your  purchase of property in Turkey. We can divide the conditions into 2 categories: Condition about your nationality: - If you want to buy only 1 property, or make a few investments, than we can say that there are no specific rules (Please check “Can I buy a property in Turkey” for more details). However if you are planing to make larger investments, purchase land etc, than some restrictions will apply. - Non-Turkish can NOT buy over 10% of a town’s land - Non-Turkish can NOT buy over 300.000 m2 of land in Turkey (no matter if bought as a whole or in different pieces and locations) without special permission from the Ministry of Interior - Non-Turkish can NOT buy a property staying within a perimeter of 400 mt to a military zone - The following are rules based on the Nationality of the Buyer Citizens of Greece: Greek citizens are NOT allowed to purchase a property in any locations in Turkey with a border to the sea. They CAN buy in other locations. Citizens of Russia & Ukraine: Can NOT buy in cities with border to the Black Sea. Citizens of Morocco: No agricultural land purchase permitted. Citizens of Egypt: No agricultural land purchase permitted. Citizens of Latvia: No agricultural land purchase permitted. Citizens of Afghanistan: No agricultural land purchase permitted and special permission needed for purchase of other type of properties. Citizens of Albania: No agricultural land purchase permitted.",
      "faq-question-5": "When can I get my TAPU (Title deed) for my property in Turkey?",
      "faq-answer-5": "Once you have chosen your property you wish to buy in Turkey and made the full payment for the property, the TAPU procedure is engaged. What is commonly known as the TAPU procedure is the process during which the Seller is ready to deliver the rights of the property to you. Depending on the location where you have bought your property (i.e in a big city as Istanbul vs. in a small coastal resort as Alanya) the procedure usually takes anything between a few couple of days up to 10 days depending on how busy the TAPU Office is.",
      "faq-question-6": "Which Documents do I need when getting my TAPU for my property in Turkey?",
      "faq-answer-6": "You need your valid passport, Turkish tax number which we help you to get it from Turkish tax office and 2 passport size photos.",
      "faq-question-7": " Do I need to pay any taxes when I am getting my TAPU?",
      "faq-answer-7": "Yes you need to pay purchase tax when you buy your property in Turkey. Prior to getting your TAPU and depending on the terms and conditions as agreed with the Seller, you will be asked to pay a “Property Purchase Taxe” of 4,4% based on value of the property.) This fee has to be paid on day of delivery of the TAPU",
      "faq-question-8": "Will anybody help me to get my TAPU?",
      "faq-answer-8": "Our colleagues will take care of everything and all you will be asked to do is to come and sign the papers to get your TAPU at Turkey tapu offices.",
      "faq-question-9": "Can I get a mortgage to buy property in Turkey from a Turkish bank?",
      "faq-answer-9": "Surely you can! But not every bank in Turkey give mortgage to non-Turkish citizens, few of the major banks have well implemented systems and attractive rates for all foreigner  property buyers. Please send us an email for more information about rates and documents needed for a mortgage.",
      "faq-question-10": "How do I pay for my purchase of property in Turkey?",
      "faq-answer-10": "Property prices are usually in Turkish Lira and/or Euros and/or US Dollars. While the Turkish Lira is widely accepted as the basis for all prices, most Sellers are flexible to accept in the currency of origin of the Buyer. Once the terms and conditions for the purchase agreed, most sellers will usually provide you with bank details and IBAN number matching the currency agreed on. All and all, money transfer is easy and safe, so you don’t have to worry about it.",
      "faq-question-11": "How can I be sure I am doing a safe purchase?",
      "faq-answer-11": "So what means doing your homework and get help fom professionals Doing your homework means that you should first know what to ask when visiting a property, so let’s check few important details for you. There are 2 types of property in Turkey to purchase: - Off plan and/or under construction - Completed properties These are the questions you should ask: For off plan and/or under construction projects Does the project have a construction license? No construction license, no right to construct, this is simple as that. Few developers sometimes choose to start to build before they get a building license, usually in order to win some time, however we, as Jasmine Homex, never take our Clients to such Companies for basic safety concerns. You can ask the developer to show you a copy of the Construction License, which they usually are happy to share with you.",
      "faq-question-12": "When will the properties be delivered, and what are the penalty clauses if there is any delay?",
      "faq-answer-12": "Buying off plan and/or under construction means that you are ready to wait for a certain time (sometimes year) before getting your property. You have to make sure that property will be delivered on time and as promised by the Construction Company, and get a compensation if and when things go wrong.",
      "faq-question-13": "Management in the Complex and what are the fees?",
      "faq-answer-13": "While this question may seem obvious, surprisingly many new homebuyers omit to ask it. A site without a proper management is literally a nightmare waiting right at the corner. While some properties look beautiful on the inside, a complex poorly managed (even sometimes not managed) will quickly become a problem, so it’s always good to know who manages the complex, what are the fees, and what are included in it. A last note about the management fee: always make sure that you will only be responsible for paying management fees starting from day you take delivery of your apartment, and not be responsible for previous periods. Our suggestion: If the complex hasn’t got a proper management established, please think about it twice.",
      "faq-question-14": "Are there any utility and or municipality debts on the property?",
      "faq-answer-14": "While it may seem surprising as a question, even some new properties, which have never been used before, may come with utility debts, coming directly from debts owned by the developer used during the construction. Always make sure to ask to write on the sales contract that you will not be responsible for debts prior to taking delivery of the property. Do NOT worry, We help you to avoide properties that aren't 100% legal so you can rest assured.",
